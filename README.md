- 👋 Hi, I’m @RAZZ-MACHINE
- 👀 I’m interested in learning to code and program. The main goal is to be able to maximally understand how the cyber and digital world work.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to become better at drawing and sketching (digitally)
- 💞️ I’m looking to maybe make a few videogames. I'd like to make a series but that's stupid expensive (I'd rather go solo on my own)
- 📫 I accept messagess, only appropriate messages are allowed
- 😄 Pronouns: Dude
- ⚡ Fun fact: I believe you have value, cherish yourself <3
